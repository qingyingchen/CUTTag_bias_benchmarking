### sra-tools developed a new tool: fasterq-dump. The fasterq-dump-tool performs a split-3 operation by default. The fasterq-dump-tool is not identical to the former fastq-dump-tool with regards to command line options. The following is a comparison between fastq-dump and fasterq-dump:

$fastq-dump --split-3 SRRXXXXXXX
$fasterq-dump SRRXXXXXXX

### These two commands are equivalent.
### The authors claim that fasterq-dump is faster than fastq-dump. However, based on my personal experience, I have found that fasterq-dump actually performs slower than fastq-dump. Ultimately, the decision on which tool to use is up to you.
